# HashtagHangman
EE551 Final Project #Hangman: What's Trending Philly??? Pulls current trending hashtags and lets a user play hangman with them

Two python modueles

The words_display module will pull all the trends from Twitter and make a list of the top 5 trending hashtags for Philadelphia

The Tweet_Trending_hangman_game module runs the hangman game pulling the word list from the words_display module

Note: I did not include my access keys to Twitter in the words_display module. This requires a twitter developer account, so this code won't run correctly unless this is added for who is using it
